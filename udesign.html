    <p>The buildings on the site aims to be reconstructed as a community center and a farmer's market. They will create recreational spaces and job opportunities of which the local residents are lack. Two of the buildings with bad conditions in this site are demolished and turned into multifunctional raingardens. These two raingardens will not only relieve the sewer systems's pressure during storm, but also providing beautiful scenery and education opportinities to site users.The blue pavement showing on pictures indicates the location of underground rain water pipe that connect with drains and rain gardens, which will help residents learn the working mechanism of storm water green infrastructure</p>

    <p>To calculate the performance of treating storm water, I picked 100-year and 10-year rainwater time series data from EPA stormwater calculator. Then I imported these two time series data, as well as ground water data, evaporation data, GI area and the area of impervious they treat, landuse run-off coefficient to EPA SWMM. The result shows this design will be able to treat 75% storm on site under 100year-storm event and 81% storm on site under 10year-storm event.</p>
