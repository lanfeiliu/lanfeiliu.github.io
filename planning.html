    <h1>Hypothetical Stormwater Management Planning</h1>
    <p>To avoid excess capital investment while maximizing ecological effectiveness of stormwater management, forecasting possible future scenarios for development, we propose urban regeneration on the issue of stormwater in Detroit through an alternative future scenario process that will identify shape, evaluate, and visualize transformative urban revitalization alternatives at the city scale and parcel scales in Detroit based on assumptions regarding future population and economic growth, as well as predicted future land use.</p>

    <section id = text class = "jumbotron">
    <p>Two aspects of stormwater challenges in Detroit are considered in this project: 1) contribution to on-site or downstream flooding 2) negative impacts to water quality. </p>
    <p>Currently, increasing frequency of extreme storms that are likely tied to climate change overburden the city's sewer system in Detroit, increasing frequency of combined sewer overflow (CSO) and neighborhood flooding. In addition, referring to the book Mapping Detroit, reduced infiltration was created by underground rivers that historically buried for city construction. This aggravates surface flooding and also causes "basement flooding".</p>
    <p>From a water quality perspective, besides the point-source pollution caused by CSO events, the primary sources for non-point source pollution in Detroit considering in this project are: phosphorous from failed septic systems and overuse of lawn fertilizers in residential area and natural land, Total Suspended Solids(TSS) from road surfaces and vehicles in highly impervious land (impervious percent>80%) and heavy metal in industrial land. </p>

    <section id = text class = "jumbotron">
    <p>Then, according to a land pattern study in Google earth, we use a population-job matrix created by overlaying population and job distribution maps to estimate future landuse.Each future scenario was assigned a final population, with spatial distribution determined by rules governing a twenty-year period.The estimation of jobs includes two parts: developing assumptions regarding total jobs by census category and mapping job distributions.</p>

    <section id = text class = "jumbotron">
    <p>We solve two major obstacles of these stormwater challenges in Detroit. First, rather than reconstructing the underground sewer system, thisstormwater management plan would leverage surface landscapes to alleviate pressure on current sewer systems will be an option. Second, we provide a prediction method for thefact ofuncertain future risks and opportunities for population growth and development in Detroit. Therefore, instead of basing plans on current land use, ourstormwater management plan that considers future development trends would have better ecological and economic performance. </p>
