          <h3>Comparing proximity measurements for social contagion in care of residential landscapes in Detroit<br></h3>
          <p>For graduate Thesis and US-IALE conference, 2017</p>  
          <p>Proximity to residence has been found to influence social effects of greening, e.g., landscape care via social contagion, in urban neighborhoods. Previous landscape studies have operationalized proximity in multiple ways, including 1) Euclidean and Network distance 2) Density 3) Walking distance and neighborhood 4) Within a parcel/a block/a census track; and 5) Visual adjacency. These measures of proximity are similar in that they may not account for homogeneity of urban ecosystems within a parcel relative to potential heterogeneity across parcels. To account for heterogeneity across parcels, we introduce a new parcel-based vector measure of proximity, Cadastral distance, which takes into account both parcel patterns and the number of parcels. In our study of social contagion we examined the “halo” effect of yard landscape care cues for residents in highly vacant neighborhoods in Detroit. Specifically, we compare Euclidean distance and Cadastral distance for their power in predicting social contagion effects of positively cared residential landscapes. Where urban ecosystem characteristics are affected by design and management decisions at the parcel scale, a Cadastral measurement may be more valid. </p>

Fellows Program at the University of Michigan, which supports full-time graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars at the University who are committed to
finding interdisciplinary, actionable, and meaningful sustainability solutions on
local-to-global scales. Our Fellowship Team worked with Teresa Gillotti and the

          <P>This project aims to reduce water quality impairments and flooding incidents on site and downstream of West Eisenhower Area. The three phases are cost-effective in the long term and advantageous ecologically, aesthetically and economically. With increasing urban development causing faster, warmer and more contaminated stormwater runoff and with climate change predictions that precipitation rates will increase, it is becoming increasingly important to design stormwater structures that are resilient. Resilient stormwater structures not only can slow, clean and cool water, they must also provide habitat in a fragmented landscape and be socially accepted. Our inclusion of native plantings, meandering stream restoration, and a boardwalk aim to increase the multifunctionality and long term success of the West Eisenhower site.

          <h3>Study on Eight Sights of Yanjing, 2013<br></h3>
          <P>For Undergraduate Thesis</p>

          <P>Eight sights of Yanjing was first found in documents in Yuan dynasty in 800 years ago. Eight sights of Yanjing have deeply influenced Beijing's culture and politics. However, there are many mistakes and flaw in existing research and at present Eight sights of Yanjing are in danger of extinction. Thus it is
valuable to analyze the eight sights of Yanjing, simulate them with computer and educate public with these research findings. First, I collected first-hand data by reading a lot and doing field research
and analyzed them to support my research findings. Then, I studies the name and time of eight sights of
Yanjing. Also, I studies location，scale and scenery of eight sights of Yanjing in every dynasty. Based on my
study, I concluded that their traits and compare them with 'finding an excuse for scene'. In addition, I analyzed
eight sights of Yanjing in a new way named 'Landscape domain space'. I compared and analyze real
eight sights of Yanjing and eight sights of Yanjing in human's mind. In the end, I showed some examples
using eight sights of Yanjing and advice on protection and development of eight sights of Yanjing.
