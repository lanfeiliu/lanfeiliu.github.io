    <h1>Maple's Diamond</h1>
    <p>This design emphasizes on the winter view of green infrastructure because of Michigan’s featured six-month snow. The idea of “Maple’s Diamond”, a seat and light that imitated the texture of ice, comes from a picture taken in Antarctica showing blue ice covered by thick snow. These seats will create beautiful daylight and night scenery with features thick snow piles in Michigan that usually last for several months. In summer, these seats would also provide rest and social space for costumers.</p>
    <p>The site maximizes the amount of the parking spaces as well as the area providing ecosystem service. There are total 163 parking spaces within the site, including 13 for ADA, 6 for drop-off and pick-up, 29 for staff and 115 for customers. Two 1 acre patches at north of the site and a smaller patch at the southeast side perform as stepping stones for birds, small animals and pollinators across the larger landscape matrix of which the site is a part. </p>
    <p>The grading design guides most of the surface flow from roofs and parking spaces to the rainwater gardens and detention basins within the site. About 70 feet of windbreaks interval, which are created by the trees in the rainwater gardens, detention basins and the patches, would help to block cold west wind in winter and provide shading for vehicles and people. </p>
    <p>The central sidewalk running through the site not only provide safe and convenient access for people passing through the large parking lot, but also serve as the central axis connecting three focus within the site: the large, the small detention basin and wood bridge, and the plaza in front of the buildings.</p>
